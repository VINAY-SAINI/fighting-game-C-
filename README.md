The PvP Battle Game is a text-based two-player combat game implemented in C#. Here's a brief description of the game:

- **Objective:** The objective of the game is to defeat the opponent player by either reducing their health to zero or by outlasting them in the battle.
  
- **Players:** The game is designed for two players, where each player controls a character with unique attributes.

- **Character Selection:** At the beginning of the game, each player selects a character from three available options:
  1. **The Undertaker:** A character with high health, low damage, and low healing ability.
  2. **John Cena:** A character with average health, average damage, and average healing ability.
  3. **Brock Lesnar:** A character with low health, high damage, and average healing ability.

- **Game Mechanics:** 
  - Players take turns to perform actions during the battle.
  - Each player has two options on their turn:
    1. **Heal:** The player can choose to heal themselves, increasing their health by a certain amount. However, if the player's health is already full, no healing takes place.
    2. **Attack:** The player can choose to attack the opponent, reducing their health by a certain amount.
  
- **Battle:** The battle continues in turns until the health of one of the players reaches zero. At the end of each turn, the game displays the current health of both players and any relevant combat actions, such as healing or attacking.

- **Game Over:** The game ends when one player's health reaches zero, and the opposing player is declared the winner.

Overall, the PvP Battle Game offers a simple yet engaging gameplay experience where players strategize their moves to outlast and defeat their opponent.
